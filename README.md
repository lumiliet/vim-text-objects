# vim-text-objects

Adds new objects for working with the entire buffer and last visual selection. `if` and `af` both operate on the entire file. `iv` and `av` both represent the last visual selection.

## Examples

`div` deletes last visual selection.
`>av.` indent last visual selection twice.
`cif` delete entire buffer and enter insert mode.
`=af` auto indents the entire file.
